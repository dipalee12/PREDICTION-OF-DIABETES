# Diabetes Prediction Model using Soft Voting

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes in the future based on certain features. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of various health metrics and historical data of individuals, and it utilizes supervised learning techniques to make predictions.

## Dataset
PIMA INDIAN DIABETES DATASET:
- Age
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Blood Pressure
- Glucose levels
- Insulin levels
- Family history of diabetes
- Pregnancy

## Model
The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow. It employs a variety of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting to predict the likelihood of diabetes. Use Ensemble Model  The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training the model, it's essential to preprocess the dataset, which may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using cross-validation or a separate validation dataset. Assess its performance using appropriate metrics.
4. **Deployment**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in a production environment where it can make predictions on new data.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
