# PREDICTION-OF-DIABETES
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions and personalized treatment plans. In recent years, the advancement of machine learning techniques has provided new opportunities for developing accurate and efficient prediction models.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes mellitus using machine learning algorithms. The project leverages a comprehensive dataset containing various clinical, lifestyle, and demographic factors collected from a large cohort of individuals. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, blood pressure, and glucose levels.
